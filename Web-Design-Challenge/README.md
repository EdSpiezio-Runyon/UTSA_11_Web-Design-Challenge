# UTSA_11_Web-Design-Challenge

### The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.

### After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs, latitude. Factor we examined included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.

### The figures found in the Assets/Images folder and the CSV file, cities.csv, found in the Resources folder were sourced from my previous UTSA_6_python_api_challenge WeatherPy/VacationPy project found in its own repository here: https://github.com/EdSpiezio-Runyon/UTSA_6_python_api_challenge.git.

### The Data page was created by importing the cities.csv file into Pandas in the csv_to_html.ipynb Python notebook, reindexing the columns, and saving the resulting DataFrame to html.  I then pasted the resulting html code into the data.html page.
